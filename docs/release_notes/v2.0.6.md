# Release v2.0.6

## Overview
This release focuses on code quality, stability, and developer experience. We have implemented Phase 1 of our Strict Typing Enforcement Plan, ensuring the core library is fully type-safe. Additionally, we have achieved **100% test coverage**, ensuring robust handling of edge cases and deprecated methods.

## Key Changes

### 🛡️ Strict Typing (Phase 1)
- **Full Type Safety**: The `fmd_api` core library (`client.py`, `device.py`, `models.py`) now passes strict `mypy` checks.
- **Improved Signatures**: Public methods now have precise return types and generic type hints (e.g., `List[Dict[str, Any]]`), improving IDE autocompletion and static analysis for consumers.
- **Configuration**: Updated `pyproject.toml` to enforce strict typing rules (disallowing untyped definitions and implicit optionals).

### 🧪 Test Coverage Improvements
- **Full Coverage**: Increased overall test coverage to **100%**.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Added comprehensive tests for `Location` parsing, including scenarios with missing dates or invalid inputs.
- **Deprecation Verification**: Added specific tests to ensure deprecated methods in `Device` (like `take_front_photo`, `fetch_pictures`) continue to function correctly while emitting appropriate warnings.
- **Command Sanitization**: Verified that `Device.lock()` correctly sanitizes and truncates messages.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Roadmap**: Added `docs/strict_typing_enforcement_plan.md` outlining the roadmap for maintaining type safety.

## Upgrade Guide
This release is fully backward compatible with v2.0.5. No code changes are required for consumers, though you may notice improved type checking results if you use `mypy` in your own projects.
